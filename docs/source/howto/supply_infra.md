# Supply your own infrastructure

The deploy stages as described in the tutorial [](/tutorials/deploy_scw.md) only targets
the case where the infrastructure (the hosts in ansible inventory) are created by a cloud provider of
our choice.

Here are some hints to adapt the procedure to supply the ifnrastructure by your own means. 

If you refer to the [](/explanations/stages.md) section, the point here is to help you make your
own "stage 0" and still fulfill all the prerequisites for upper-level deployment stages.

## Have your target DNS in mind

Hashistack is designed to be delegated a DNS domain authority. The parent domain is a root variable to supply to the
`make init_instance` command.

## Init

* Keep the init phase to setup a local directory dedicated to your hashistack deployment:

```{code-block}
:caption: Initiate an instance directory
> make init_instance name=dark-grass parent_domain=scw.wescale.fr archi=mono
> cd inventories/hs_dark_grass
```

That will generate a working framework.

Once done, fill the `ssh.cfg` and `inventory` files to get your desired topology (refer to [](/explanations/inventory.md)).

* Validate your inventory by running:

```{code-block}
> ansible -m ping -b all
```

## Network capability

For now, all hosts need a route to Internet. You can validate this by running (from your `inventories/hs_instance_name` directory):

```{code-block}
> ansible-playbook ../../playbooks/test_egress.yml
```

## DNS integration

You will have to deal with domain delegation to give authority to the `hashistack_sre` instance for that domain.

For example, if you intend to have an Hashistack managing `hashistack.your.org` then:

* the parent domain is `your.org`
* these records should exist in the `your.org` zone file:

```{code-block}
:linenos:
hashistack      NS     ns.hashistack.your.org.
ns.hashistack   A      <ipv4 of hashistack_sre host>
ns.hashistack   AAAA   <ipv6 of hashistack_sre host>
```

## Configuration

TO BE DETAILED.

Look for the generated files when we deploy to Scaleway and adapt to your case.

* `<project root>/roles/stage_0/templates/mono/out.stage0.hashistack.yml.j2`
* `<project root>/roles/stage_0/templates/multi/out.stage0.hashistack.yml.j2`
* `<project root>/roles/stage_0/templates/multi/out.stage0.hashistack_sre.yml.j2`

## TLS Certificates

Once you:
* can reach your hosts and become a privileged user on them.
* ensured that your hosts can reach Internet.

You are almost ready to start the automation storm.

### LetsEncrypt

If you want LetsEncrypt certificates, you need to have your hashistack_sre exposed to Internet 
(as any polite DNS authority server).

If that is the case you can run:

```{code-block}
> make stage_1_bootstrap stage_1_addon_certs_letsencrypt stage_1_rproxy
> make stage_2 stage_3 stage_4
```

### Supply your own certificates

Get by any means a wildcard certificate for the DNS domain delegated to the 
`hashistack_sre` host (covering `*.hashistack.your.org` for example). Place the files
under your `inventories/hs_instance_name` directory at these locations:

* `group_vars/hashistack/secrets/self.cert.key`
* `group_vars/hashistack/secrets/self.cert.pem`
* `group_vars/hashistack/secrets/self.fullchain.cert.pem`

Then install hashistack by running:

```{code-block}
> make stage_1_bootstrap stage_1_rproxy
> make stage_2 stage_3 stage_4
```

The project is currently mostly centered around our demo technical case based on Scaleway. This
will change to ease deployment on any infrastructure.
